# For AI Assistants

If you use AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor, you can provide them with the full documentation context using these files:

- [llms.txt](/llms.txt) - Documentation index with links to all pages
- [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) - Complete documentation in a single file

## Usage

Copy the URL and paste it into your AI assistant's context, or ask it to fetch the content:

```
https://rut-kit.pages.dev/llms-full.txt
```

This helps the AI understand the full API and provide more accurate code examples.
